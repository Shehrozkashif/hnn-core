At the large distances between cells and M/EEG sensors, this 'primary' current is the main contributor to the measured fields. Close to the cells, the local field potential (LFP) is the result of intracellular current leaking into the extracellular medium through active and passive membrane channels. Under some simplifying assumptions, we may approximate the LFP at virtual electrodes placed in and around the HNN network model.",
